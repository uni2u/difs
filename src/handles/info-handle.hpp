/**
 * @brief WriteHandle provides basic credit based congestion control.
 *
 * First repo sends interests of credit number and then credit will be 0.
 *
 * If a data comes, credit++ and sends a interest then credit--.
 *
 * If the interest timeout, repo will retry and send interest in retrytimes.
 *
 * If one interest timeout beyond retrytimes, the fetching process will terminate.
 *
 * Another case is that if command will insert segmented data without EndBlockId.
 *
 * The repo will keep fetching data in noendTimeout time.
 *
 * If data returns with FinalBlockId, this detecting timeout process will terminate.
 *
 * If client sends a insert check command, the noendTimeout timer will be set to 0.
 *
 * If repo cannot get FinalBlockId in noendTimeout time, the fetching process will terminate.
